# Voice-controlled-Home-Automation-System
Hardware system which allows a user to give commands to Arduino device and control events such as show temperature, turn on lights etc.

# Introduction
Our project is a prototype of an autonomous Home System which will rely solely on the user's voice commands. It would consist of a 1SHEELD+ device and a smartphone with the corresponding 1Sheeld app installed on it to get the user input. There would be an lCD Keypad shield to display information of the system. And there would be LEDs or lightbulbs to display the system function (turning on and off). All the different components will be processed by the program uploaded in the Arduino board. </br>

Program uploaded in the Arduino board will process all the input data from the 1SHEELD Device. Then output will be given accordingly to the LEDs and LCD Display. The main objective of the Home Autonomous system is for the user to control house appliances by using his speech only. Hence the main objective of the 1Sheeld device is to relay information from the smartphone voice input and transmit it to the Arduino software which can then be processed in the code. This will reduce user effort to control appliances by a substantial amount. At the same time money will be saved due to time saving and effort can be used on more important things. </br>

There are many companies which are innovating to Home Autonomous Systems. But currently there is no commercially viable system for the consumers. But if more projects such as ours are being built in more universities then innovations will take place faster and the prices will reduce. 


# Set-up
- Download and Install Arduino IDE(Latest version) from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
- Buy Arduino UNO board from https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino/most-popular
- Connect Arduino and other components accordingly, compile and upload your code and start using the product.

# Summary
## A) Functions
1.	Design a cheap and portable Home Automation System which works with new technology known as a 1SHEELD+ Device.
2.	Receives input from User in the form of Voice commands such as “Turn off lamp” or “Turn off AC” and much more.
3.	Output of Device is seen in the turning on and off of LEDs or other appliances.
4.	Display received commands with other information on the LCD screen.
 

## B) Requirements
1.	Arduino Uno – Microcontroller for Project
2.	PC with Arduino IDE
3.	1SHEELD+ device – Acts as our communication device between speech and the Arduino
4.	Smartphone (iOS or Android) with 1SHEELD application installed and Bluetooth enabled – Receives voice input from USER.
5.	Resistors for LEDs ~ 200Ω – Regulate brightness of the LEDs.
6.	Breadboard – Used for testing components on.
7.	LCD Keypad Shield – Displays information of the System.
8.  TMP36 - Temperature Sensor.
9.  RTC - Real-Time Clock to display current Time.
10.	Relays (AC250V 10A; DC30V 10A) – Connects Arduino to real appliances by stepping up the Arduino Voltage.


# Conclusion
This project can be replicated in multiple quantitities.
